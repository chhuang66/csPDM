# csPDM
These codes are the implementations of colored-synapse population density method (csPDM), used to simulate large-scale network dynamics of one single neuronal population where neurons receive both the exitatatory and inhibitory inputs only from the outside. The details of the csPDM  are described in Huang, Chih-Hsu and Lin, Chou-Ching K. <i>An efficient population density method for modeling neural networks with synaptic dynamics manifesting finite relaxation time and short-term plasticity</i>, accepted by the <i>eNeuro</i> (prepared for publication, 2018).

This implementaion is written by C++ and is compiled by cmake.
